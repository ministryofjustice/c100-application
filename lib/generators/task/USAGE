Description:
    Generates a task, including;

    - task supercontroller
    - empty decision tree

Example:
    rails generate task Sometask

    This will create:
        app/controllers/steps/some_task/some_task_step_controller.rb
        app/services/c100_app/some_task_decision_tree.rb

    This will update:
        config/routes.rb
          (adds a route namespace for the task)

    You will have to do yourself:
        - Make the decision tree decide something
        - Add specs for the decision tree
        - Add i18n
