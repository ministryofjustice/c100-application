    <p class="govuk-body">A MIAM is not mediation. It is an initial meeting where an authorised family mediator will consider
      with you (and the other party if present) whether family mediation, or another form of non-court dispute resolution,
      would be a more appropriate way for you to resolve the dispute. The mediator will also be able to signpost you to other help and support services.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">If you think youâ€™re exempt from attending a MIAM, you must be prepared to explain your reasons to the court.
      Where evidence is required, this must be submitted alongside this application to court.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">You do not have to attend a MIAM if:</p>
