    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Using this online service</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      This online service is run by the Ministry of Justice. We want as many people as possible to be able to use it.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">For example, that means you should be able to:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts</li>
      <li>zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
      <li>navigate most of the online service using just a keyboard</li>
      <li>navigate most of the online service using speech recognition software</li>
      <li>listen to most of the online service using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">We’ve also made the text as simple as possible to understand.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      <a href="https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/" class="govuk-link" rel="external" target="_blank">AbilityNet</a> has
      advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">About the accessibility of this online service</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Basic tests were performed on this online service on 15 May 2020. These tests were carried out by the Ministry of Justice.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      We tested the start page, the login page and the contact page, as well as the privacy policy and the terms and
      conditions.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">We also tested the stages of the service that require different types of user interaction:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>inputting text</li>
      <li>inputting numbers</li>
      <li>using radio buttons</li>
      <li>using check boxes</li>
      <li>following links for support</li>
      <li>finding an address by searching for a postcode</li>
      <li>reviewing answers</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">Finally, we tested cookies and the third-party supplier feedback survey page.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What to do if you cannot access parts of this online service</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      If you need information on this online service in a different format like an accessible PDF, large print, easy
      read, audio recording or braille, email
      <a href="mailto:c100helpdesk@digital.justice.gov.uk?subject=Accessibility" class="govuk-link ga-clickAction" data-ga-category="accessibility" data-ga-action="click" data-ga-label="mailto helpdesk">c100helpdesk@digital.justice.gov.uk</a>.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Technical information about accessibility for this online service</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      The Ministry of Justice is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies
      (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      This online service is partially compliant with the
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/" class="govuk-link" rel="external" target="_blank">Web Content
        Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1</a> AA standard, due to the non-compliances listed below.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Non compliance with the accessibility regulations</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Some pages may be non-accessible where further inputs are revealed based on a checkbox or radio selection. We’re
      working to understand whether these nested inputs are fully accessible.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">We plan to resolve this issue by September 2020.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">PDF content</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Some PDF content is essential to providing our services, but may not yet meet accessibility standards for screen
      readers. The PDF content is designed to be used by the courts and is built to their specification, so any changes
      will require their input. We plan to review this content by September 2020.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Third-party supplied service</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">This online service uses a third-party supplied service to collect feedback.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      This third-party supplied service is “skinned” to look like our website, but part of it does not meet
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/" class="govuk-link" rel="external" target="_blank">Web Content
        Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1</a> standards because clicking the labels does not move the cursor into the
      corresponding text area.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      The third-party supplied feedback form is one part of our overall approach to collecting feedback. We'll continue
      to carry out further testing as we develop the service and we plan to reassess the feedback form by September
      2020.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Reporting accessibility problems</h2>

    </p>
