    <p class="govuk-body">Collaborative lawyers work with you and the other parent to resolve your issues out of court. You each hire a lawyer then all meet to negotiate face-to-face.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">The collaborative process involves several steps but is usually quicker and cheaper than going to court.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">Collaborative law is suitable for people who can still communicate with each other but may have complex legal issues to resolve.</p>
