    <p class="govuk-body">With lawyer negotiation you don’t deal directly with the person. You hire a lawyer to negotiate arrangements for you.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">You can still hire a lawyer to negotiate on your behalf even if the other person chooses not to use one.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">Lawyer negotiation is suitable for people who prefer not to meet because their relationship is still difficult, or because there’s a lack of trust.</p>
