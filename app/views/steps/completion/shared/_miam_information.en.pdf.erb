<p>
  Before making an application for a child arrangements order, prohibited steps order or specific issue order (a section
  8 order) you must first attend a Mediation, Information and Assessment Meeting (MIAM). At the MIAM an authorised family
  mediator will consider with you (and the other party if present) whether family mediation, or another form of non-court
  dispute resolution, would be a more appropriate way for you to resolve the dispute. The mediator will also be able to
  sign post you to other help and support services.
</p>

<p>
  You must have attended a MIAM before making this application unless the requirement to attend a MIAM does not apply because:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>the section 8 order you are applying for is a consent order; or</li>
  <li>the section 8 order you are applying for concerns a child who is the subject of separate ongoing emergency
    proceedings, care proceedings or supervision proceedings (or is already the subject of an emergency, care or
    supervision order); or
  </li>
  <li>you are exempt from the requirement to attend a MIAM. Where evidence is required to support a MIAM exemption
    claim, you must submit this evidence alongside your application.
  </li>
</ul>
