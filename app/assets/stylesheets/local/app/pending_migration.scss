// Styles here might not be possible to migrate to the new Design System
// if there is not an immediate equivalent, or in case they are really
// needed for something custom we are doing in this service.

// As an interim solution we will accumulate here these as we find them
// and once we have completed the migration we can get back to these and
// refactor/replace with standard styling or remove the ones not needed.
